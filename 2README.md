###Assignment Two

This assignment a user is promted for two numbers that should be swapped. 

//Algorithm for swapping the two numbers.

1. Start
2. Declare two integer variables m and j.
3. Prompt the user to enter values for m and j.
4. Read the input values and store them in m and j.
5. Display the values of m and j before swapping.
6. Call the swap function with the addresses of m and j.
7. Inside the swap function:

     Use a temporary variable temp to store the value of *a.

     Assign the value of *b to *a.

     Assign the value of temp to *b.

8. Display the values of m and j after swapping.
9. End.

###Pseudocode

BEGIN
FUNCTION swap(a, b)

    DECLARE temp AS INTEGER
    temp = VALUE AT a
    VALUE AT a = VALUE AT b
    VALUE AT b = temp

END FUNCTION

MAIN

    DECLARE m, j AS INTEGER

    PRINT "Please enter any number m: "

    READ m

    PRINT "Please enter any number j: "

    READ j

    PRINT "Before swap: m =", m, " j =", j

    CALL swap(ADDRESS of m, ADDRESS of j)

    PRINT "After swap: m =", m, " j =", j
END
